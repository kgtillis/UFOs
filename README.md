# UFOs

## Project Overview
Given the following task to create a dynamic website using JavaScript to create a visulization to display and filter stored data from local files. The website created is centered around UFO sightings, and a starting filter was created to display entries with a specific date. 

## Resources
 - Javascript version ES6+
 - HTML5, CSS3 
 - Data: data.js

## Summary
Website created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases the different UFO sightings around the world. 

## Challenge Overview
Request made to include additional filters that would update results based on combined entered values for date, city, state, country, and UFO shape, in order to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. 

## Challenge Summary
Additional functions were created within the code to meet these requirements. A function was created to update the filters parameters based upon any changes to the entry inputs within the web page. A second function was created to apply the filter results on the data table and update the results. 

### Recommendations for Further Development:
 - Adding additional filters for all column headers.
 - Ability to enter a range of dates to filter by.
 - Ability to enter multiple text entries to modify filters, i.e. multiple states or countries.
